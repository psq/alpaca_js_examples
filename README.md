Port of the python example algo to Javascript (node.js)

Clone the repo
```
git clone https://github.com/psq/alpaca_js_examples.git
cd alpaca_js_examples
```

Install the dependencies
```
npm i
```

Then create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` by including your keys instead of the placeholders

Run the example with
```
node test1
```

Run the algo with
```
npm start
```

In case it crashes, it should restart.
